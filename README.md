# TSP-solver
A few different approaches to solve the [Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) in Java.

## How does it work?
A few test files are available in the dedicated folder. Use Load.java to select the files you wish to use.
The entry point is the file BestTSP.java (yes, I am aware there are better TSP solvers out there). The files City.java and Graph.java are used for the data structures.
The rest of the classes are the different implementations: DFS, Nearest Neighbour and Two-Opt. The latter two include different flavours.
